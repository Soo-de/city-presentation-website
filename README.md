# city-presentation-website
This project is a website showcasing my city, developed to learn and implement API usage, JavaScript frameworks, PHP, HTML, and CSS. The website aims to provide information about the cityâ€™s attractions, culture, and history, while practicing modern web development techniques.


## Notes
This project was developed as the final project for the Web Technologies course in the second semester of my 1st year at Sakarya University.
